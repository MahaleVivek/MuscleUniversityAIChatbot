<!-- As a user, I want to hear sound alerts when sending and receiving messages
so conversations feel more immediate (and asynchronous)

The previous description follows the following brief structure:

As **[the actor]**, I want **[the something]** so I can **[the goal]**.

    The actor — the person using the feature.
    The something — what the user needs the feature for.
    The goal — why the user needs it. -->

- [ ] The outgoing sound alert is played when a message is sent.
- [ ] The incoming sound alert is played when a message is received. -->
