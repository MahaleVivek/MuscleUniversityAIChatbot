Lanarky is an open-source framework to deploy LLM applications in production.
It is built on top of `FastAPI <https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi>`_ and comes with batteries included.

‚ùì Why?
-----------------

There are great low-code/no-code solutions in the open source to deploy your LLM projects. However,
most of them are opinionated in terms of cloud or deployment code. This project aims to provide users
with a cloud-agnostic and deployment-agnostic solution which can be easily integrated into existing
backend infrastructures.

üíæ Installation
-----------------

The library is available on PyPI and can be installed via ``pip``.

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install lanarky
